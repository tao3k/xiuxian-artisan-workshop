# Standard: Link-Driven Metadata & Identity Positioning (V5.0)

We decouple the **Discovery** of a skill from the **Validation** of its content.

## 1. Skill Discovery (The Wendao Law)

A directory is recognized as a **Skill** if and only if it contains a physical **`SKILL.md`** file.

- **Physical Identifier**: `SKILL.md` serves as the anchor for the `wendao://skills/` namespace.
- **Trigger**: The presence of `SKILL.md` triggers the high-precision `xiuxian-skills` parser.

## 2. Content Validation (The Skills Law)

Once discovered, the `xiuxian-skills` engine enforces the following:

### 2.1 Default Standards (Optional but Recommended)

- **AUDIT.md**: Highly recommended for industrial traceability. If missing, a warning is emitted, but the skill is accepted.

### 2.2 Strict Metadata Schema

Every `.md` file (Skill manifest or Persona) MUST pass the `UnifiedMetadata` validation.

- **type**: Must be explicitly `skill` or `persona`.
- **metadata**: High-fidelity identity fields are mandatory.
- **Failure**: malformed YAML or missing 'type' will trigger a load-blocker for that specific asset.
