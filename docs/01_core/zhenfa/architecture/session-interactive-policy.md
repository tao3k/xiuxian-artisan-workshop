# Session Interactive Policy & Human-Centric Design

This document defines the behavioral standards for `omni-agent` interaction, heavily inspired by the human-centric optimizations found in the `OpenClaw` research.

## 1. Interaction Modes (`QueueMode`)

| Mode            | Behavior                                                 | Use Case                                            |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Queue`**     | Messages are processed one by one.                       | Standard task execution.                            |
| **`Interrupt`** | **[High Priority]** New message kills the previous task. | Correcting a model that has gone off-rails.         |
| **`Steer`**     | Input is injected as a "Hint" into the ongoing process.  | Long-running planning tasks.                        |
| **`Collect`**   | Wait for $X$ ms of silence before replying.              | Group chats where users send multiple short bursts. |

## 2. Session Reset Logic

### 2.1 Implicit Reset (The "Stale" State)

When a message arrives, the system checks `updated_at`:

```text
If (now - updated_at) > config.idle_timeout_mins:
    Archive old context -> Initialize NEW context
    Insert system notice: "Previous session expired due to inactivity."
```

### 2.2 Scheduled Reset (Daily Cleanse)

Configurable via `daily_reset_hour`. Ensures the agent starts every morning with a "Tabula Rasa" (Clean Slate) for maximum reasoning accuracy.

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Workflow

For tools marked as `restricted: true` or when `send_policy: "deny"` is active:

1. Agent generates a "Proposed Action" (e.g., `rm -rf ./tmp`).
2. `ZhenfaOrchestrator` intercepts and creates a **Pending Approval** record in Valkey.
3. Telegram/Discord sends a message with **[Approve]** and **[Deny]** buttons.
4. Logic remains suspended until a callback is received.

## 4. Behavioral Tuning Knobs

Users can adjust these parameters per-session to control the "Character" of the interaction:

- **`ThinkingLevel`**: Maps to `max_tokens` and CoT (Chain of Thought) prompt depth.
- **`VerboseLevel`**: Adjusts system instructions to prefer brevity or detailed explanations.
- **`ElevationLevel`**: Controls the threshold for tool execution permissions.

## 5. Metadata-Driven UX (Auto-Titles)

To aid in session recovery after restart:

- **First-Msg-Title**: The first 60 characters of the opening message are extracted as the session's `displayName`.
- **Iconography**: `group_activation` status ("Mention-only" vs "Always-listening") should be reflected in the session metadata for UI display.

## 6. Runtime Progress Snapshot (2026-02-28)

The policy is now partially operational in live channels with concrete command-path behavior:

- **`/session scope` alias is active** and maps to `/session partition` for both Telegram and Discord command handlers.
- **Authorization is stable** because ACL selectors are evaluated against canonical command identity.
- **Reply text is normalized** to `channel` scope language in both channels.
- **Partition persistence is available** via user TOML when explicitly enabled.

### 6.1 Persistence Controls

User TOML:

- `telegram.session_partition_persist`
- `discord.session_partition_persist`

Environment overrides:

- `OMNI_AGENT_TELEGRAM_SESSION_PARTITION_PERSIST`
- `OMNI_AGENT_DISCORD_SESSION_PARTITION_PERSIST`

### 6.2 Live Operator Check

Recommended quick check sequence:

1. Enable `telegram.session_partition_persist = true` in user `xiuxian.toml`.
2. Send `/session scope user json`.
3. Validate persisted value in `.config/xiuxian-artisan-workshop/xiuxian.toml`.
4. Send `/session scope json` to confirm runtime and persisted mode match.
