## Historical Note

This document previously described the old routing system with wisdom-aware and state-aware routing. The new Trinity Architecture routing system uses:

- **OmniRouter**: Unified entry point
- **HiveRouter**: Multi-hive routing strategy
- **SemanticRouter**: Vector-based matching
- **IntentSniffer**: Context detection
