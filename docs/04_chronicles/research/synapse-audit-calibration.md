- **Saliency:** 9.5 (Foundational)

## 1. Core Logic: The Adversarial Loop

The Synapse-Audit method replaces "Generation" with "Verification-Cycles".

### 1.1 The Math of Calibration

Let $C$ be the Claim and $E$ be the set of Evidence Anchors.
$$ ext{Confidence}(C) = \prod\_{e \in E} ext{Alignment}(C, e) \cdot (1 - ext{Drift})$$
Where **Drift** is the entropy introduced by the **Skeptic Persona**.

### 1.2 The LuZhe GuangFei Adaptation

In our "Dual-Link" system, Synapse-Audit acts as the **Dynamic Link Validator**.

- Every research claim creates a **Backlink** to the source code.
- If the Skeptic finds a "Dead Link" (code that doesn't support the claim), the saliency of that claim is reset to zero.

## 2. Engineering Requirements for Implementation

1. **Precision Slicer**: We must slice code into smaller "Functional Passages" (Passage Nodes in Wendao).
2. **Persona Multi-Inject**: Qianhuan must support parallel injection of the Prospector/Skeptic/Calibrator trinity.
3. **Omega Step-Gate**: Omega must not release the final report until the `Drift < 0.05` criterion is met.

## 3. Reflections

This methodology directly addresses the "Information Noise" problem reported in the current `research` skill. By forcing the Skeptic to actively try to _disprove_ the research, we eliminate hallucinations.
