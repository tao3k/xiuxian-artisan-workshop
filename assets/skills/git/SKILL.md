# Git Skill (Smart Commit Workflow)

> **Code is Mechanism, Prompt is Policy**

## Smart Commit Workflow (Primary Query Anchor)

`smart commit` is the canonical query phrase for this skill.
Use `git.smart_commit` to run the full smart commit workflow (stage -> scan -> approve -> commit).

## Architecture

This skill uses `@skill_command` decorator in `scripts/*.py` files.
Commands are automatically exposed via MCP as `git.command_name`.

## Available Commands

| Command            | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git.status`       | Show working tree status                                |
| `git.stage_all`    | Stage all changes (with security scan)                  |
| `git.commit`       | Commit staged changes                                   |
| `git.smart_commit` | Smart Commit workflow (stage → scan → approve → commit) |
| `git.push`         | Push to remote                                          |
| `git.log`          | Show commit logs                                        |

## Smart Commit Workflow

Use `git.smart_commit` for secure, human-in-the-loop commits:

```python
# Step 1: Start workflow
git.smart_commit(action="start")
# Returns workflow_id and diff preview

# Step 2: After LLM analysis and user approval
git.smart_commit(action="approve", workflow_id="xxx", message="feat: description")
```

**Flow:** `stage_and_scan` → `route_prepare` → `format_review` → `re_stage` → `interrupt` → `commit`

## Staged Files Feature

### Stage and Scan Workflow

The `stage_and_scan` function provides automatic staging with security validation:

```
Stage All Files → Security Scan → Lefthook Pre-commit → Finalize
```

#### Key Features

1. **Automatic Staging**

   ```python
   stage_and_scan(project_root=".")
   # Returns: {staged_files, diff, security_issues, lefthook_error}
   ```

2. **Security Scanning**
   - Detects sensitive files (`.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.secret`, etc.)
   - Automatically un-stages detected files
   - Returns list of security issues

3. **Lefthook Integration**
   - Runs pre-commit hooks after staging
   - Re-stages files modified by lefthook formatters
   - Returns lefthook output for review

### Staged Files Commands

| Command           | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `git.stage_all()` | Stage all changes with security scan      |
| `git.status()`    | Show staged files and working tree status |
| `git.diff()`      | Show staged diff                          |

### Security Patterns Detected

```
.env*, *.env*, *.pem, *.key, *.secret, *.credentials*
id_rsa*, id_ed25519*, *.priv
secrets.yml, secrets.yaml, credentials.yml
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Read Operations (Safe - Use Claude-native bash)

```bash
git status
git diff --cached
git diff
git log --oneline
```

### Write Operations (Use MCP Tools)

| Operation    | Tool                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Stage all    | `git.stage_all()` (scans for secrets) |
| Commit       | `git.commit(message="...")`           |
| Push         | `git.push()`                          |
| Smart Commit | `git.smart_commit(action="start")`    |

## Key Principle

> **Read = Claude-native bash. Write = MCP tools.**
