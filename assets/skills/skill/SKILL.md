# Skill Manager

The Skill Manager provides tools for discovering, installing, and managing skills in the Omni-Dev-Fusion system.

## Commands

### discover

**[CRITICAL] Tool Registry Lookup** - The ONLY way to call @omni commands!

**MANDATORY RULE:** Before calling ANY `@omni(...)` command, you MUST call `skill.discover` first to get the exact tool name and usage template. Direct `@omni` calls are FORBIDDEN.

**When to use:**

- ANY time you want to call a tool via `@omni(...)`
- You are unsure which tool to use
- You need the exact tool name and arguments schema
- You are starting any new task that requires a tool

**Example:**

```
User: "I want to analyze this GitHub repo"
→ Call skill.discover(intent="analyze github repository structure")
→ Returns: @omni("software_engineering.analyze_project_structure", {"depth": 3})
→ NOW call the tool with confidence
```

### jit_install

Install and load a new skill from the remote repository.

### list_index

List all available skills in the system.
