# Module 02: The Mechanics of Engineering

> **"Technical writing is engineering. It requires precision, economy, and structure."** — _Barry J. Rosenberg_

This module treats text like code. We apply "refactoring" to sentences to maximize signal-to-noise ratio.

## 1. The Refactoring Table (De-cluttering)

Just as you delete dead code, you must delete dead words. Use this lookup table to refactor your writing:

| The Clutter (Avoid)         | The Clean Code (Use) | Why?                                                |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Utilize**                 | **Use**              | "Utilize" is marketing fluff. "Use" is engineering. |
| **Facilitate**              | **Help**             | Vague corporate jargon.                             |
| **In order to**             | **To**               | Waste of bytes.                                     |
| **At this point in time**   | **Now**              | "Now" is immediate and powerful.                    |
| **Is capable of**           | **Can**              | Avoid converting verbs into nouns.                  |
| **Perform a calculation**   | **Calculate**        | Don't "perform" actions; just do them.              |
| **Basically / Essentially** | **[Delete]**         | Filler words that add zero information.             |

## 2. Strong Verbs & Active Voice

### 2.1 The "To Be" Ban

Avoid static verbs like `is`, `are`, `was`, `were` where possible. They describe state, not action.

- _Weak_: "There is a function that handles the request."
- _Strong_: "The function **handles** the request."

### 2.2 Active Voice (Default)

Passive voice hides the "actor" (the subject performing the action).

- _Passive_: "The configuration was loaded." (By whom? The kernel? The app? The user?)
- _Active_: "The application **loaded** the configuration."

## 3. The Law of Parallelism

In lists and bullet points, consistency is mandatory. This is known as **Parallelism**.

- **The Rule**: All items in a list must start with the same part of speech (usually an Imperative Verb for instructions).

> **Bad (Syntax Error)**:
>
> 1. Open the terminal. (Verb)
> 2. Configuration of the environment. (Noun)
> 3. You should run the build. (Sentence)

> **Good (Parallel)**:
>
> 1. **Open** the terminal.
> 2. **Configure** the environment.
> 3. **Run** the build.

## 4. Sentence Logic

### 4.1 One Idea Per Sentence

Do not create "run-on" sentences that glue multiple thoughts together with "and".

- _Spaghetti_: "The script downloads the dependencies and then checks for updates and finally compiles the binary."
- _Clean_: "The script downloads dependencies. Then, it checks for updates. Finally, it compiles the binary."

### 4.2 Specificity

- _Ambiguous_: "The system failed."
- _Specific_: "The Nginx process exited with code 1."
