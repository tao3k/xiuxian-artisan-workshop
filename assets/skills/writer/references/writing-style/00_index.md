# Omni-Dev-Fusion Technical Writing Standard

> **The Grand Unification of Documentation**
>
> This standard unifies the precision of engineering with the clarity of teaching. It is built upon four pillars:
>
> 1.  **The Feynman Principle**: Clarity through mental models and concrete examples.
> 2.  **The Zinsser Principle**: Humanity, rhythm, and the elimination of clutter.
> 3.  **The Rosenberg Standard**: Engineering rigour, strong verbs, and parallelism.
> 4.  **The Claude Axiom**: Structural optimization for AI context and few-shot reasoning.

## The Final Commit Checklist (Mental Linter)

Before merging any documentation, run this "linter" on your writing.

### Logic & Teaching (Feynman/Zinsser)

- [ ] **Concrete First**: Did I provide a real-world example or analogy _before_ explaining the abstract theory?
- [ ] **ELI5**: Did I explain jargon? Would a smart junior developer understand this without external help?
- [ ] **Human Tone**: Did I read it aloud? Does it sound like a human conversation, or a corporate robot?

### Mechanics & Precision (Rosenberg)

- [ ] **De-clutter**: Did I replace "utilize" with "use", and "in order to" with "to"?
- [ ] **Active Voice**: Did I state _who_ is acting? (e.g., "The script builds the app" vs "The app is built").
- [ ] **Parallelism**: Do all list items start with the same part of speech (e.g., all Imperative Verbs)?

### AI & Structure (Claude)

- [ ] **Few-Shot Examples**: Did I provide `Input -> Output` code blocks for every command or function described?
- [ ] **Hierarchy**: Is the Markdown nesting (H1 -> H2 -> H3) logical and unbroken?
- [ ] **Explicit Context**: Did I avoid ambiguous pronouns like "it" or "that" when referring to complex systems?
