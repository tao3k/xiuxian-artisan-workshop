# Spec: Concept Documentation Template System

> **Status**: Approved
> **Complexity**: L2
> **Owner**: @omni-coder

## 1. Context & Goal (Why)

_Standardizing conceptual documentation structure across the codebase to improve onboarding and reduce cognitive load._

- **Goal**: Create a reusable template that ensures all concept documentation follows a consistent structure, making it easier for developers to understand complex systems.
- **User Story**: As a new developer, I want documentation that explains not just what a system does, but why it exists and how it works, so I can contribute effectively without extensive mentorship.

## 2. Architecture & Interface (What)

_Defines the documentation template contract that all concept docs must follow._

### 2.1 File Changes

- `docs/explanation/template.md`: Created (this template serves as both documentation and the template itself)
- `docs/explanation/{concept-name}.md`: Created (new concept docs follow this structure)

### 2.2 Data Structures / Schema

```python
class ConceptDocumentation(BaseModel):
    """Schema for all concept documentation."""
    summary: str  # 1-2 sentence overview
    context: ContextSection
    mental_model: MentalModelSection
    mechanics: MechanicsSection
    decisions: list[DesignDecision]
    roadmap: Optional[str]

class ContextSection(BaseModel):
    pain_point: str  # What was wrong before
    goal: str  # What we were solving for

class MentalModelSection(BaseModel):
    analogy: str  # Physical metaphor explaining the concept
    diagram: Optional[str]  # Mermaid chart reference

class MechanicsSection(BaseModel):
    components: list[Component]
    data_flow: str  # How requests travel through system

class DesignDecision(BaseModel):
    decision: str
    pros: str
    cons: str
```

### 2.3 API Signatures (Pseudo-code)

```python
def create_concept_doc(
    name: str,
    summary: str,
    context: ContextSection,
    mental_model: MentalModelSection,
    mechanics: MechanicsSection,
    decisions: list[DesignDecision],
    roadmap: Optional[str] = None
) -> str:
    """Generates a new concept document following the standardized template."""
    return render_template("concept", name, summary, context, mental_model, mechanics, decisions, roadmap)

def verify_doc_compliance(doc_path: str) -> bool:
    """Validates that a concept document follows all template sections."""
    required_sections = ["Context", "Mental Model", "Mechanics", "Design Decisions"]
    doc_content = read_file(doc_path)
    return all(section in doc_content for section in required_sections)
```

## 3. Implementation Plan (How)

1. [ ] **Define Template Structure**: Establish the 5-section structure (Context, Mental Model, Mechanics, Decisions, Roadmap) in `docs/explanation/template.md`
2. [ ] **Create Placeholder Content**: Replace template examples with Omni-Dev-Fusion-specific examples where appropriate
3. [ ] **Add Related Links Section**: Include references to tutorials, how-tos, and API docs for cross-linking
4. [ ] **Document Integration Points**: Clarify how concept docs connect to tutorials and reference materials
5. [ ] **Update Documentation Index**: Add this template to the docs navigation hierarchy

## 4. Verification Plan (Test)

_How do we know it works? Matches `agent/standards/feature-lifecycle.md` requirements._

- [ ] **Template Compliance**: New concept docs include all required sections (Context, Mental Model, Mechanics, Design Decisions)
- [ ] **Cross-Reference Validation**: Each concept doc links to at least one related tutorial or how-to guide
- [ ] **Example Completeness**: The template itself contains complete, realistic examples (not just placeholders)
- [ ] **Reader Understanding**: New developers can explain a system after reading its concept doc without additional context
