# xiuxian-qianhuan

Xiuxian-Qianhuan injection engine for Omni Rust runtime.

## Naming Origin

This injection system is branded as **Xiuxian-Qianhuan**:

- **Xiuxian**: continuous cultivation and refinement of reasoning quality.
- **Qianhuan**: thousand transformations, representing fast role adaptation and mixed-domain composition.
- Chinese name: **修仙-千幻** (Xiuxian-Qianhuan).
- Naming reference: _cultivation + thousand transformations_.

In runtime terms, Xiuxian-Qianhuan means:

- the system can transform into different role packs for different workflows,
- combine specialist perspectives in one turn,
- inject high-signal context into execution with deterministic policy and bounded cost.

## Why This Crate Exists

`xiuxian-qianhuan` is the dedicated context injection interface layer.
It is intentionally separate from planning and execution engines.

Responsibilities:

- Parse and normalize structured injection payloads.
- Enforce bounded injection windows and deterministic output.
- Serve as the foundation for role-mix and classified injection modes.
- Provide a stable contract for runtime context assembly.

Non-responsibilities:

- No workflow planning (Graph responsibility).
- No tool execution loop (ReAct responsibility).
- No global policy arbitration (Omega responsibility).

## Runtime Position

The crate is embedded between policy and execution:

1. Omega selects policy, mode, and role mix.
2. Xiuxian-Qianhuan assembles injection snapshot.
3. Graph/ReAct consume the snapshot.
4. Reflection and memory evolution run after execution.

## Injection Model

Current foundation in this crate:

- XML Q&A payload parsing (`<system_prompt_injection><qa>...`).
- Bounded window with size limits (`InjectionWindowConfig`).
- Canonical rendering and normalization for deterministic replay.

Planned extension surface:

- `single` mode: one compact injection block.
- `classified` mode: category-aware injection with per-category budgets.
- `hybrid` mode: role-mix + classified blocks in one immutable snapshot.

## Key Types

- `InjectionWindowConfig`
- `QaEntry`
- `SystemPromptInjectionWindow`
- `InjectionError`
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT_INJECTION_TAG`
- `PromptContextBlock`
- `InjectionPolicy`
- `InjectionSnapshot`
- `RoleMixProfile`

## Example

```rust
use xiuxian_qianhuan::{InjectionWindowConfig, SystemPromptInjectionWindow};

let raw = r#"
<system_prompt_injection>
  <qa>
    <q>What is the active runtime constraint?</q>
    <a>Keep execution deterministic and bounded.</a>
    <source>omega.policy</source>
  </qa>
</system_prompt_injection>
"#;

let normalized = SystemPromptInjectionWindow::normalize_xml(raw, InjectionWindowConfig::default())?;
println!("{normalized}");
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

## Architecture Boundaries

- Core memory policy/lifecycle belongs to Rust memory core (`omni-memory`), not this crate.
- This crate focuses on context injection assembly only.
- External MCP clients can use memory/knowledge tool facades, while runtime policy stays in Rust core packages.
