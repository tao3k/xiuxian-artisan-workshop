# Rust Crates for Omni-Dev-Fusion

> Rust Workspace - Managed from project root `Cargo.toml`

This directory contains Rust crates for the Omni project. The workspace is managed from the **project root** (`omni-dev-fusion/Cargo.toml`).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build all crates from project root
cd omni-dev-fusion
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test -p omni-sniffer
cargo test -p omni-vector

# Build Python bindings (from project root)
uv sync --reinstall-package omni-core-rs
```

## Trinity Architecture

These crates power the **Trinity Architecture**:

- **The Librarian** (`omni-vector`): Vector store for semantic memory
- **The Surgeon** (`omni-edit`): AST-based code editing
- **Hyper-Immune System** (`omni-security`): Security and sanitization

## Python Binding Usage

```python
from omni_core_rs import PyVectorStore, PyOmniSniffer

# Vector store for semantic memory
store = PyVectorStore("./data/vectors", dimension=1536)

# Environment sensing
sniffer = PyOmniSniffer(".")
snapshot = sniffer.get_snapshot()
```
