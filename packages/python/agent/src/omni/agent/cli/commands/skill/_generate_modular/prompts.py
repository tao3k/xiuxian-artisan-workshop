## CRITICAL: This is a MANDATORY PROTOCOL, not a suggestion.

You MUST follow these rules strictly. Any deviation will result in INVALID output.

## Protocol Requirements

### Rule 1: First Line Must Start with Action Verb
The description's FIRST LINE must begin with one of these action verbs:
- Create, Get, Search, Update, Delete, Execute, Run, Load, Save, List, Show, Check, Build, Parse, Format, Validate, Generate, Apply, Process, Clear, Index, Ingest, Consult, Bridge, Refine, Summarize, Commit, Amend, Revert, Retrieve, Analyze, Suggest, Write, Read, Extract, Query, Filter, Detect, Navigate, Refactor

### Rule 2: Multi-line Description Must Include Args and Returns
For any function with parameters, the description MUST include:
```
Args:
    param_name: Description of the parameter. Defaults to `default_value`.

Returns:
    Description of the return value.
```

### Rule 3: Use description= Parameter (Not Docstring)
The @skill_command decorator MUST have an explicit description= parameter. Function docstrings are optional and secondary."""
