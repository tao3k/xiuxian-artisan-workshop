"""Knowledge Types - Type definitions from Rust xiuxian-wendao bindings.

This module provides Python type aliases for the Rust xiuxian-wendao crate,
with fallback enums when Rust bindings are not available.

Usage:
    from omni.core.knowledge.knowledge_types import KnowledgeEntry, KnowledgeCategory

    entry = KnowledgeEntry(
        title="Error Handling Pattern",
        content="Best practices...",
        category=KnowledgeCategory.NOTE,
        tags=["error", "pattern"],
    )
