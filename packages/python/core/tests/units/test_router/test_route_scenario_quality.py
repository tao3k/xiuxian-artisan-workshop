"""Scenario-based tests for routing algorithm quality.

Validates that diverse user phrasings route to the expected skill/tool families
using the real skills index (assets/skills). Run after `omni sync`; uses same
fixtures as test_route_hybrid_integration (router_for_integration, sync from SKILLS_DIR).

Three kinds of scenarios:
- Short/keyword-style: "git commit", "find python files" (baseline intent).
- Realistic conversational: full sentences, e.g. "I need you to analyze a git repo,
  I'll give you some requirements" → researcher.
- Compound intent (action + follow-up requirement): one action first (e.g. crawl a
  site), then different requirements (analyze, extract data, let the model research
  further). User might say "crawl this website, then analyze it" or "爬取网站然后
  提取数据/分析" — we expect the first-step tool (crawl4ai) or follow-up (researcher
  / analyze) to appear in top results.

Flow: run tests → fix skill routing values or algorithm → re-run until green.
